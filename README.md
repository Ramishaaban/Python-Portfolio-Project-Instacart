# Python-Portfolio-Project-Instacart
This is a Python portfolio project which I completed as part of the Data Analytics course by CareerFoundry. Instacart, an internet-based grocery store accessible via a mobile app, aims to gain deeper insights into customer buying patterns as part of its efforts to formulate a marketing strategy.
