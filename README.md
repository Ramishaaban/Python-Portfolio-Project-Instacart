# Python-Portfolio-Project-Instacart
This is a Python portfolio project which I completed as part of the Data Analytics course by CareerFoundry. Instacart, an internet-based grocery store accessible via a mobile app, aims to gain deeper insights into customer buying patterns as part of its efforts to formulate a marketing strategy.

## Objectives
Our task is to conduct an initial data analysis and exploratory examination of the data to uncover insights and propose segmentation strategies based on the given criteria. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of diverse Instacart customers and their buying patterns, ultimately leading to the development of a precise marketing strategy.

## Datasets
CareerFoundry has provided the following datasets to use in the project:
+ orders
+ orders_products_prior
+ products
+ customers
+ departments

## Tools used
I used Python within the Anaconda Navigator software environment, primarily utilizing Jupyter Notebook along with the pandas and NumPy libraries.

## Folders Structure
The organization of the basket analysis involved categorizing the folders into the following directories:
+ 01 Project Management: Includes the Project Brief document.
+ 02 Data: Subdivided into Original and Prepared Data, housing the unaltered data frames and the cleaned, analysis-ready data frames, respectively. Note: This folder is excluded on Github due to its size.
+ 03 Scripts: Comprises all Python codes utilized throughout the analysis.
+ 04 Analysis: Encompasses the visualizations utilized for generating insights and for presentation in the final report.
+ 05 Sent to client: Stores the Final Report in Excel format.
