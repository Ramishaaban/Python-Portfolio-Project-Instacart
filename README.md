# Python-Portfolio-Project-Instacart
This is a Python portfolio project which I completed as part of the Data Analytics course by CareerFoundry. Instacart, an internet-based grocery store accessible via a mobile app, aims to gain deeper insights into customer buying patterns as part of its efforts to formulate a marketing strategy.

## Objectives
Our task is to conduct an initial data analysis and exploratory examination of the data to uncover insights and propose segmentation strategies based on the given criteria. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of diverse Instacart customers and their buying patterns, ultimately leading to the development of a precise marketing strategy.

## Datasets
CareerFoundry has provided the following datasets to use in the project:
+ orders
+ orders_products_prior
+ products
+ customers
+ departments
